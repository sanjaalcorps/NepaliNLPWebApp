# NepaliNLPWebApp
The web app used for Nepali Language Natural Language Processing - Work in Progress - <b>Leisure Time Project.</b>

<b>What is in this app?</b><br/>
A lot, but here are few things worth mentioning:
1. Tool to crawl websites and extract content from the website.
2. Preeti to Unicode Java Tool
3. Devanagari to ISO Standard Romanization
4. Nepali Stemmer (Given a word, find the root)
5. Nepali Corpus Formation Tools
6. Sentence Tokenizer for Nepali Text
7. Sentence and Word Clenser for Nepali Text
8. A web app that allows me to manually validate the words, word roots, sentences, romanization and classify both sentences as well as words


<b>What am I trying to do?</b><br/>
1. Apply Deep Learning, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence to Nepali Text
2. Sentiment Analysis for Nepali Text
3. Autosummarizer for Nepali Text
4. Data Mining (e.g. from twitter and facebook).
5. Nepali Parts of Speech Tagging (POS)
6. Nepali Shabdakosh in Unicode
7. Word Cloud Generation for Nepali Text
8. 1 Billion Nepali high quality Nepali Sentences {HIGH AMBITION / ACHIEVABLE}
9. Automated bots(chats, recommendations, etc)  in Nepali Language (If you didn't know, Bots are new things, replacing apps)
10. Simple Question Answer Web (Machine Generated Question Answer Based on Data Fed. E.g. Who is the current prime minister of Nepal? XYZ). Chatbot could be used instead of apps. For example, you type in questions to a chat bot, they will answer you.

A database of
1. More than 200,000 webpages having Nepali Text (Text already extracted)
2. More than 600,000 words Nepali Corpus
